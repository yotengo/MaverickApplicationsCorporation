To run our source code:
1)	Install xampp from the internet. This is a webserver that will allow you to run our site from localhost. There are Windows and Mac versions available.
2)	Extract the files from our code package’s zip and move the contents of src (but not the folder src) to htdocs in the xampp folder.
3)	Place sendmail folder in the xampp directory
4)	Replace php.ini in xampp/php with the php.ini file in the src folder
3)	Bring up the xampp control panel and make sure apache is running (on mac the app is called manager-osx, on windows it is called xampp)
4)	In a web browser type the URL: localhost/views/login.php
5)	The site should work as described in the test cases.
